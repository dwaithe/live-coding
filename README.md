# live-coding
This is a repository containing notebooks demonstrating how to code in Python and are associated with corresponding live-coding YouTube videos. The goal of this work is to show you how to approach image analysis in Python in a very practical sense. You will learn about image structure and formats and about the various libraries which can support image analysis.
