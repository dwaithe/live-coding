# live-coding
This is a repository containing Jupyter lab notebooks demonstrating how to code in Python and are associated with corresponding live-coding YouTube videos. The goal of this work is to show you how to approach image analysis in Python in a very practical sense. You will learn about image structure and formats and about the various libraries which can support image analysis.

## How to Solve a Maze:

In this notebook and associated video I do some live-coding in Python to describe and demonstrate how to solve a maze rendered in graphical form. In this video I implement a simple breadth-first graph searching algorithm to find the shortest route through a maze, as well as show simple thresholding and image plotting. The notebook can be found in the directory 'how-to-solve-a-maze', or through this link:

## Object colocalization:

In this notebook and assoicated video I demonstrate how to go about performing an object-based colocalization analysis procedure, using fluorescence microscopy derived images. I showcase histogram-based thresholding and also Find-maxima methods of segmentation. Finally I show how to compare the distances between foci in two different channels and how to organise the data using pandas. The notebook can be found in the directory 'how-to-solve-a-maze', or through this link:

## Find Maxima 2-D:

In this notebook and assoicated video I demonstrate how to go about applying a 2-D maxima algorithm to wide-field and fluorescence microscopy derived images. axima finding (or peak finding) is a technique for finding the locations of intensity maxima within a data signal. To understand more about theory, please visit the associated video tutorial which goes through the theory and functioning of the algorithmic approach also: https://youtu.be/8YEPRf2C8Dw
The code created from this practical is here:
